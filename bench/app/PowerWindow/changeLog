Added

#ifndef NULL
#define NULL   ((void *) 0)
#endif

to header file powerwindow.h

Deleted #include <stdio.h> in all files replaced with headerfile powerwindow.h

Deleted function powerwindow_GetErrorStatus(void) and the related code

Commented  
	long tic, toc, tictoc;
	tic = powerwindow_get_cycles();
	toc = powerwindow_get_cycles();
	tictoc = toc-tic;
	printf("%ld\n",tictoc ); 

in the int main(void).  Uncomment can print the execution time of the powerwindow benchmark.
