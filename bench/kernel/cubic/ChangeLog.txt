Original provenience: MiBench benchmark suite,
                      http://wwweb.eecs.umich.edu/mibench

2016-02-09:
- Added TACLeBench header
- Renamed benchmark from 'basicmath_small' to 'basicmath'
- Fixed a typo in code comments: 'soem' -> 'some'
- Removed unused variable 'n' from the main funcion
- Added variable 'double Y' to the main function and accumulated the results of
  'deg2rad(X)' and 'rad2deg(X)' in this variable so that the compiler warning
  'statement with no effect' is fixed.
- Removed conditionally compiled main (test) function from isqrt.c
- Removed conditionally compiled main (test) function from cubic.c
- Removed commented-out code
- Removed unused function, variable, macro and type declarations, structs and
  unions
- Removed seemingly unnecessary empty lines
- Renamed memcpy.t to basicmath_libc.c
- Removed unused files:
  rad2deg.c
  sniptype.h
  sniptype.h
- Created basicmath_libc.h and put declaration of basicmath_memcpy() in it
- Reorganized snipmath.h so that the following are in the given order just
after the header
  - includes
  - declarations of functions
- Reorganized sniptype.h so that the following are in the given order just
after the header
  - macro definitions
  - type definitions
- Removed duplicated copyright information from wcclibm.c
- Removed __STDC__ checks from wcclibm.c and used only ANSI style function
  arguments
- Removed 'last modified' comments from files
- Removed mention 'use __kernel_rem_pio2f()' from comments of function 
  __ieee754_rem_pio2f() since it doesn't really use it.
- Removed math functions specialization macros from wcclibm.h and updated call
  sites with explicit nameks of the functions.
- Removed '#define double float' from wcclibm.h and replaced all 'double's
with 'float's in the benchmark
- Added a new main function that calls the old main function
- Annotated basicmath_main() as the entry point of the analysis
- Applied code formatting according to the following rules
  - Lines shall not be wider than 80 characters; whenever possible, appropriate
    line breaks shall be inserted to keep lines below 80 characters
  - Indentation is done using whitespaces only, no tabs. Code is indented by
    two whitespaces
  - Two empty lines are put between any two functions
  - In non-empty lists or index expressions, opening '(' and '[' are followed by
    one whitespace, closing ')' and ']' are preceded by one whitespace
  - In comma- or colon-separated argument lists, one whitespace is put after
    each comma/colon
  - Names of functions and global variables all start with a benchmark-specific 
  prefix (here: statemate_) followed by lowercase letter
  - For pointer types, one whitespace is put before the '*'
  - Operators within expressions shall be preceded and followed by one
    whitespace
  - Code of then- and else-parts of if-then-else statements shall be put in
    separate lines, not in the same lines as the if-condition or the keyword
    "else"
  - Opening braces '{' denoting the beginning of code for some if-else or loop
    body shall be put at the end of the same line where the keywords "if",
    "else", "for", "while" etc. occur

2017-06-27
- Introduce basicmath_init and basicmath_return functions.
- Add prefix basicmath_ to global variables.
- Introduce dummy initialization in ieee754_rem_pio2f to please linter.

2017-07-10
- Fix possible stack buffer overflow caused by sizeof of incorrect type.

2019-03-07
-split basicmath into seperate files
-Add TACLeBench Header 
-put each benchmark into a seperate folder
-adjust the code formatting to the common TACLeBench code style
